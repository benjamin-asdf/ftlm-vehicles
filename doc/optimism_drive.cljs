;; (ns optimism-drive)

;;
;; The brain is a dynamic information processing device, this is McChullochs big step.
;;
;;
;; As programmer, it is tempting to conceptualize cognition and the mind:
;;
;; The mind is a programmer, programming itself on the computer it is runnig on
;;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;; This has a problem: Where is the software coming from?
;; What is this program, this software this abstracted entity inside the cognition machine?
;;
;; Of course we have Dawkins in mind, and our hunch is, it is evolved.
;;
;; I would submit, if cognition is an algorithm and if it is evolved, then you need to be able to
;; point to the algorithm in its infancy (perhaps in a simple vehicle).
;; 1. Say how this is evolutionarily, biologically, plausible to evolve and
;; 2. you show how this algorithm evolves more complicated (evolutionarily plausible at every step).
;; No skyhooks allowed - it needs to bootstrap itself.
;;
;; Guenther Palm called something similar the survival algorithm (or something like that).

;; ------------------
;; The Optimism Drive
;; ------------------
;;
;; I would submit we can observe the basic algorithm in vehicle 1.
;; Vehicle 1 has nervous system of a kind (the simplest we can imagine, with 1 connection).
;; The connection makes the meaning (consider that a sensor doesn't do anything on its own.
;; The meaning of the sensors and motors comes from what they are connected too).
;;
;; Consider an environemnt for vehicles, where hot temperature zones are bad for the vehicle.
;; Consider something like vehicle 1, with the option for different wiring (plausible from genetics)
;; A - hot means move
;; B - hot means *don't* move
;; ... everything else is useless and will be rejected by evolution.
;;
;; It depends on your meaning now if you are useful or not.
;; If hot temperature is bad and you are a vehicle of type A, you move away from hot temperature and you succeed.
;; If you are of vehicle of type B, your meaning was not good, and your genes are rejected.

;; In hindsight, we can say that type A is optimistic, since its wiring says
;; 'if I move, I will move out of hot temperature'.
;; Type B is pesimistic 'if I am in the hot, I will stay in the hot'.
;; We can see something like a 2/2 matrix forming here (meaning / competence) where only one kind of vehicle survives:
;; A vehicle with optimistic wiring that is competent enough so the meaning of its wiring leads to success.
;; With competency I mean that the sensors, motors and connections (the brain) works well.
;;
;; This brings us out of the conundrum where we needed to wonder where the algorithm comes from.
;; We can see the algorithm here in its infancy. It is that information processing has meaning, when you connect it
;; to motors.
;;
;; Both optimism and success are part of this fundamental algorithm, then.
;; Natural selection puts us in a high-competency, high-optimism world of what minds are.
;; What is the purpose of the brain? In some ways the answer is to be optimistic.
;; The other aspect of this is the competency, but this competency is only useful if it leads to success in the world.
;;
;;
;; Alternatively you might call this 'the success algorithm', the survival algorithm, the optimism drive,
;; purpose engine, meaning with consequences mechanism, the 'evolution favors competence' mechanism.
;;

;; The beatiful thing is that we not only have the mechanism, there is a more ephemeral entity in the story.
;; It is similar to Dennetts free-floating-rationals, or what we call the function (as in structure and function)
;; in biology and anatomy.
;;
;; We can call this entity the algorithm that the vehicle is implementing. It is not the sensors, motors, actuators,
;; connections, body or environment - it lives in the interplay of all those.
;;
;;
;; I think the concept that optimism is fundemental is exhalting as fuck.
;; There is grandeur here. There is grandeur is this view... from such humble a beginning (thinking of vehicle 1).
;; ...All purpose is being evoloved!
;;
;;
;; What then is the fundamental operation of a mind? The root instruction spawning all sub processes (or something?)
;; You might say 'be optimistic', 'pretent to be useful'.
;; (if at any step it fucks it up, it is rejected by evolution).
;; (if it is competent but pessimistic, it will be rejcted)
;; (if it is optimistic but unlucky, it is rejected, too).
